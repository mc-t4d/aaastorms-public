Introduction
This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope of work, possible deliverables, and skills/experience needed for a Python developer to work on the AAAStorms codebase 
implemented with AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and EventBridge. The codebase is deployed using the Serverless framework 
and hosted on GitHub. 

Objectives
The objectives of this scope will vary based on current needs of the team/project. 
Some example objectives are as follows:
- Improve and optimize the existing codebase implemented in Python; add data sources or enhance the reporting functions.
- Enhance the functionality of AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions, and EventBridge.
- Ensure proper integration and communication between various AWS services.
- Implement best practices for security, scalability, and performance.
- Maintain the codebase on GitHub and ensure proper version control.

Deliverables
The following deliverables should be included in any SOW to ensure documented, sustainable codebase for future development:
- Updated and enhanced codebase implemented in Python.
- Optimized AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions, and EventBridge configurations.
- Unit tests for the implemented code.
- Documentation of changes made, including code documentation and architecture diagrams.
- Regular progress updates and communication with the project team.
- Timely resolution of any issues or bugs encountered during development.

Skills/Experience
The following skills and experience are recommended for a developer working on future development. 
- Proficiency in Python programming language, including knowledge of its core libraries and frameworks.
- Experience in developing scalable and maintainable Python applications.
- Understanding of Python best practices, code optimization, and performance tuning.
- Familiarity with Python testing frameworks and writing unit tests.
- In-depth knowledge and hands-on experience with various AWS services, including Lambda, Step Functions, SES, and EventBridge.
- Ability to design, develop, and deploy serverless applications using AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
- General knowledge of the data sources, NOAA/National Hurricane Center, WFP ADAM Live Map, and GDACS is a strong asset.
